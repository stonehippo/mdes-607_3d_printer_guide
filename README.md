## BEFORE YOU PRINT ANYTHING
**Before you print anything with the printer, READ THIS WHOLE GUIDE! This mandatory, to keep the equipment running well for you and everyone else in MDes**. If you have any questions about what you read here, please reach out me at gwhite@massart.edu. There's no bad questions and it is much better for us to chat before wasting time, energy and filament!

## About The MDes Studio 3D Printer
The MDes studio 3D printer is an [Elegoo Neptue 2S](https://us.elegoo.com/products/neptune2s-fdm-printer?_pos=7&_psq=neptune+2s&_ss=e&_v=1.0). This is an FDM (filament) printer, which means that it uses thermoplastic filament to produce prints. It does this by heating up the plastic and then pushing it through a tiny nozzle, sort of like squeezing out a line of toothpaste, but much smaller and in a very controlled way. Filament printing isn't the only type of 3D printing, but it's the most common and typically the most cost effective and simplest way to print.

## Software
You will need the following software to work with our 3D printer:

- [Elegoo Slicer](https://www.elegoo.com/pages/download?c1=3d-printers-slicing-softwares) - This is the _slicer_ for converting 3D models into _g-code_, the command langauge understood by the printer.

## Materials

There are couple of different material types that you can use with the studio printer:

- PLA - the most commom material choice. PLA is fairly inexpensive, (theorhetically) bio-degrable, doesn't produce very strong fumes, and is easy to work with, so your prints are more likely to come out OK, even with default settings.
- PETG - similar to PLA in that it is simple to work with and relatively inexpensive, PETG is a better choice for some applications because it has a higher melting point and is more resistant to shocks. This makes it more suitable than PLA for outdoor applications or for durable mechinical parts.

While there are many other types of material available for FDM printers, **do not use them with the studio printer!** This includes technical materials like ABS or ASA; these materials are expensive, hard to work with, produce a lot more unpleasant fumes, and tend to fail far more often on a open printer like ours. While you _might_ be able to get them to work with the printer, it's going to take a lot of fiddling and some heartache. Stick to PLA or PETG!

In addition, please try to stick to basic versions of PLA/PETG. There are several formaulations, across and within the various suppliers. Some of these will be easy to use with the printer while others are probably best avoided.

### PLA
**DO** use "basic" PLA, and you can also use filament branded as PLA+/PLA Pro—tends to make stronger prints that basic PLA—or Rapid PLA, which has a higher flow rate and is good for speeding up the printer and reducing the print time; this can be _very_ handy when you're trying to do rapid prototyping!

**Don't** Use PLA with embedded materials, such as glass (PLA-GF) or carbon fibers (PLA-CF). There are a couple of reasons for this: these materials are more abrasive than standard PLA and will wear down the nozzle faster. Second, PLA-GF/PLA-CF may require some additional settings to work correctly. And lastly and they're more expensive.

**Note:** if you really want to try these out, please reach out to me at gwhite@massart.edu and let's see if we can make it work. There are some embedded materials that, while still more expensive and trickier to print with, will produce interesting prints. This includes wood or glitter embedded in the base material. If you would like to try those out, let me know.

### PETG

Like PLA, **do** use basic, PETG+, or Rapid PETG filaments, and **don't** use those with embedded materials without first checking with me.

### Bringing your own filament
There is some filament in the studio, specifically gray PLA+ from Inland. This is a relatively inexpensive PLA, so feel free to use it.

You can also bring your own filament for use in the printer. Make sure that you're following the recommendations above. I recommend that you contant me to check in _before_ you buy any filament for the printer, just to make sure that you're getting something that will work.

The studio printer uses 1.75mm filament. This is the most common diameter, but be careful. Some filament is **2.85mm in diameter and will not work with this printer.** Confirm the diameter before you buy any filament that you intend to use on the studio printer.
